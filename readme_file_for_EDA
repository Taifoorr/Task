Bivariate Analysis in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables.
It helps identify patterns, correlations, or differences between the two variables, often involving a dependent and an independent variable.

Types of Bivariate Analysis:
Numerical-Numerical (Correlation):

Scatter plots and correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) are used to study the linear or nonlinear relationships between two numerical variables.
Example: Height vs. Weight.
Numerical-Categorical:

Box plots, bar charts, or t-tests/ANOVA help understand the distribution of numerical data across different categories.
Example: Income vs. Gender.
Categorical-Categorical:

Cross-tabulation, chi-square tests, and bar charts are used to explore the relationship between two categorical variables.
Example: Education Level vs. Employment Status.
Bivariate analysis is a crucial step in data exploration, helping identify associations or dependencies between variables.
